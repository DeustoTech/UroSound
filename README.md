##  Folder Structure ## 
-------------
- `audios_dataset`: voiding events audio files recorded with the UroSound App and the Oppo smartwatch, for 8 volunteer patients
- `standard_uroflowmetries`: standard uroflowmetry test results for 8 volunteer patients
- 
Note: to preserve the privacy of the volunteer patients, they have been idenficied with an ID: Ai, i=2,...,6 y Bj, j=5, 7 y 8.
